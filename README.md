# LRU Cache in Android

This project is a simple Android app built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** to learn and demonstrate **LRU-style caching**.

Products are fetched from an API on first load and stored in an in-memory cache. Subsequent loads fetch data directly from the cache to avoid unnecessary network calls.
